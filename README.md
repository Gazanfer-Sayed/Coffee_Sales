# Coffee Shop Data Analysis in Excel


**Project Description**:
In this Excel-based project, I conducted an in depth data analysis of a coffee shop’s sales to identify trends & patterns. The project encompasses:

- **Data Compilation**: Aggregation of sales and customer data into a single orders worksheet through utilization and combination of advanced Excel functions such as Xlookup, Index Match along with IF statements.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Rigorous cleaning and validation to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Data Analyzing**: This project leverages the powerful data analysis capabilities of Excel’s pivot tables and pivot charts to uncover hidden patterns and insights.
- **Data Visualiization**: An engaging and informative dashboard that visually represents sales trends, customer behavior, and other key metrics.

The dashboard highlights key business metrics through dynamic visual elements such as line graphs, bar charts, and dropdown menus. The use of pivot tables and charts allows for easy manipulation and examination of data, providing valuable insights into sale trends and customer preferences.

This Excel-based data analysis of the coffee shop's sales can answer several key business questions such as:

1. How do sales fluctuate over time?

2. What are the most popular products?

3. What purchasing patterns emerge among different customer segments?

4. What is the most preferred packaging size?
   
5. What are the sales for each country?

6. Who are the top 5 customers?
