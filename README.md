# Coffee Shop Data Analysis in Excel


**Project Description**:
This Excel-based project delves into a detailed data analysis of a coffee shop’s operations. It encompasses:

- **Data Compilation**: Aggregation of sales and customer data into a single orders worksheet through utilization and combination of advanced Excel functions such as Xlookup, IF and Index Match.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Rigorous cleaning and validation to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Data Presentation**: Creation of an engaging and informative dashboard that visually represents sales trends, customer behavior, and other key metrics.

The dashboard highlights key business metrics through dynamic visual elements such as line graphs, bar charts, and dropdown menus. The use of pivot tables and charts allows for easy manipulation and examination of data, providing valuable insights into sales trends and customer preferences.


This Excel-based data analysis of the coffee shop’s operations can answer several key business questions:

1. How do sales fluctuate over time?

2. What are the most popular products, and what purchasing patterns emerge among different customer segments?

3. What are the top 3 countries by total sales or by different coffee types?

4. Who are the top 5 customers?
